Memecoin Adventure Park: Full Development Roadmap
1. Project Overview
* Name: Memecoin Adventure Park
* Description: A decentralized gaming platform featuring casino-style games integrated with ERC-20 token liquidity pools (LPs). The platform acts as the "house," where winnings and losses flow back into the LPs. House edge splits rewards between the LP and the platform owner’s wallet.
* Goal: Develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) with three games: Roulette, Blackjack, and Slots, focusing on decentralized LPs and on-chain randomness.
* Target Platform: Web-based for desktop and mobile, with future plans for a Telegram mini-app.

2. Full Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Planning and Preparation
1. Define Requirements:

   * Core features (games, LP structure, token support).
   * Smart contract specifications (house edge logic, bet limits).
   * Frontend design (responsive UI).
   * Backend needs (minimal services for session tracking).
   2. Set Up Development Environment:

      * Install tools: Node.js, Hardhat, Metamask, Web3.js/Ethers.js.
      * Deploy testnet wallet and tokens (e.g., USDC, ETH).
      * Create GitHub repository for code management.
      3. Research On-Chain Randomness:

         * Temporary: Use block time as a seed.
         * Long-term: Plan for Chainlink VRF or similar solutions.
         4. Finalize Architecture:

            * Modular smart contracts for LPs and game logic.
            * React-based frontend with Web3.js integration.
